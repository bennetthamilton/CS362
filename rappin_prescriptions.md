# Rappin's Prescriptions

1. Use the TDD process to create and adjust your code's design in small,
   incremental steps.

2. In a test-driven process, if it's difficult to write tests for a
   feature, strongly consider the possibility that the design of the
   underlying code needs to be changed.

3. Another good approach is to use the test to design what you want a
   successful interaction of the feature to look like.

4. When possible, write your tests to describe your code's behavior, not
   its implementation.

5. Keeping your code as simple as possible allows you to focus
   complexity on the areas that really need it.

6. Choose your test data and test-variable names to make it easy to
   diagnose failures when they happen. Meaningful names and data that
   doesn't overlap are helpful.

7. Using Capybara allows you to simulate user activity for end- to-end
   tests of your Rails features.

8. Placing business logic outside Rails classes makes that logic easier
   to test and manage.

9. Use `:aggregate_failures` to get the best features of
   single-assertion and multiple-assertion tests.

10. Your tests are also code. Specifically, your tests are code that
    does not have tests.

11. Think about both the short-term and long-term cost of tests as you
    write them.

12. If you find yourself writing tests that already pass given the
    current state of the code, that often means you're writing too much
    code in each pass.

13. Refactoring is where a lot of design happens in TDD, and it's
    easiest to do in small steps. Skip it at your peril.

14. Try to extract methods when you see compound Booleans, local
    variables, or inline comments.

15. Expectations that cover different branches of the application logic
    should be handled in separate specs.

16. Fixtures are particularly useful for global semistatic data stored
    in the database.

17. Your go-to build strategy for `factory_bot` should be
    `build_stubbed` unless there is a need for the object to be in the
    database during the test.

18. Avoid defining associations automatically in `factory_bot`
    definitions. Set them test by test, as needed. You'll wind up with
    more manageable test data.

19. Use partial doubles when you want to ensure most of your real object
    behavior. Use full doubles when the behavior of the stubbed object
    doesn't matter—only its public interface does.

20. The use of the `allow_any_instance_of` stub modifier often means the
    underlying code being tested could be refactored with a more useful
    method to stub.

21. A stubbed method that returns a stub is usually okay. A stubbed
    method that returns a stub that itself contains a stub probably
    means your code is too dependent on the internals of other objects.

22. Don't mock what you don't own.

23. By far the biggest and easiest trap you can fall into when dealing
    with integration tests is the temptation to use them like unit
    tests.

24. Use Capybara's JavaScript integration-testing capabilities sparingly
    lest you be very, very annoyed. Test as much as possible within each
    layer, separate from the others.

25. A request test should test behavior of a single request. A request
    test should not fail because of problems in the model.

26. When testing a Boolean condition, make sure to write a test for both
    halves of the condition.

27. When testing for view elements, try to test for DOM classes that you
    control rather than text or element names that might be subject to
    design changes.

28. The decision to write tests is much more important than the testing
    tool you choose to write them.

29. Security issues are often just bugs. Most of the practices you
    follow to keep your code bug-free will also help prevent and
    diagnose security issues.

30. Always do security testing in pairs: the blocked logic and the okay
    logic.

31. When a single change in your code breaks multiple tests, consider
    the idea that your testing strategy is flawed.

32. Write your test to be as close as possible to the code logic that's
    being tested.

33. Adding user authentication can be very disruptive to existing tests.
    Try to get the basic infrastructure in place early.

34. Test for mass assignment any time you have an attribute that needs
    to be secure and a controller method that touches that class based
    on user input.

35. Use an automatic security scanner to check for common security
    issues.

36. Mediating interaction to an external server through an adapter that
    is part of your code makes the interaction both easier to test and
    easier to use.

37. Use the VCR gem to allow your integration tests to run against
    server response data.

38. Use the adapter to test client behavior without being depen- dent on
    the server API.

39. Test the error code based on which object in the system needs to
    respond to the error.

40. When a formerly passing test fails, something has changed.

41. Using `p` and various related methods is a quick and easy way to get
    a sense of why a test is behaving badly.

42. Use `git bisect` to track down mysterious failures in your code when
    you have no idea how they were inserted.

43. If you have a slow test suite, you can mitigate the effects in
    practice by being able to run a relevant subset of tests.

44. Use RSpec metadata like :focus or :slow to be able to run arbi-
    trary groups at once.

45. Use `rspec --only-failures` and `rspec --next-failure` to only run
    failing specs, which allows you to focus on failures easily.

46. If you specify a test by line number, be sure not to add lines to
    the file. Added lines could make it so you aren't running the test
    you think you're running.

47. Rails is not your application; it is a framework on which you build
    your application—unless you work at Basecamp and actually develop
    Rails.

48. If you have enough time to break focus while your tests run, you
    aren't getting the full value of the TDD process.

49. This is your regular reminder that software is complex and there are
    multiple paths to success.

50. The only way to know the boundaries of a new coding tool is to go
    past them. Try things.

51. You can use test doubles to remove test dependencies.

52. You don't need to start with elaborate object indirection, but it's
    useful when logic gets complicated.

53. When dealing with legacy code, respect code that works. You don't
    know what constraints the previous coders worked under.

54. When writing initial unit tests for legacy code, use the test to
    explore the code's behavior. Try to write a passing test without
    changing code.
